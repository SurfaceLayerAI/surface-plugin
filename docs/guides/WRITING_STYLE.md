## Sentence Craft

### No Contractions

Write every word in its full form. "Do not" instead of "don't." "It is" instead of "it's." "Cannot" instead of "can't." This creates deliberate, measured prose that signals care in the writing.

**Before:** "You won't need to manage git branches manually. It's handled automatically."
**After:** "Manual branch management is not necessary. The system handles it automatically."

### Active Voice by Default

Name who or what performs the action. Use passive voice only when the object genuinely matters more than the actor.

**Before:** "PRs are decomposed into reviewable tasks by the system."
**After:** "Surface decomposes PRs into reviewable tasks."

Acceptable passive: "Tasks are ordered by dependency." (The ordering matters more than who orders.)

### Ban Weak Openers

Never begin a sentence with "It is," "There is," "There are," "This is," or "That is." These constructions bury the real subject and produce flat writing.

**Before:** "There are three ways to configure decomposition depth."
**After:** "Decomposition depth accepts three configurations."

**Before:** "It is important to review each task before approving the stack."
**After:** "Review each task before approving the stack."

### Minimize "To Be"

Actively replace "X is Y" constructions with specific verbs. "The dashboard shows" instead of "the dashboard is where you see."

**Before:** "The review panel is a place where you can see all assigned tasks."
**After:** "The review panel displays all assigned tasks."

### Present Habitual Tense

Describe what the product does as ongoing fact, not future promise or one-time event.

**Before:** "Surface will analyze your PR and generate review tasks."
**After:** "Surface analyzes the PR and generates review tasks."

### Rhythm

Vary sentence lengths deliberately. A longer sentence that builds context, followed by a shorter one that lands, creates natural emphasis. But exercise restraint: use short standalone sentences sparingly, roughly one per ten to fifteen sentences. Overusing them creates a staccato cadence that reads as affected.

**Before:** "Fast. Smart. Effortless. Surface changes everything."
**After:** "Surface processes PR stacks of ten or more in under 200 milliseconds, rendering the full dependency graph before the page finishes loading."

### No Em Dashes

Never use em dashes. They are associated with AI-generated writing. Use colons, separate sentences, or restructure instead.

**Before:** "The decomposition engine is fast — processing stacks in under 200ms."
**After:** "The decomposition engine processes stacks in under 200 milliseconds."
